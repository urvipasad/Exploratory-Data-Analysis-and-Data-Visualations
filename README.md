## 1. EDA on Boston Crime Rate
This EDA I have analyzed crime incident reports in the city of Boston from June 2015 to September 2019. I have used Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries for  EDA and Data visualization.
- This EDA uncovers following insights from the data
  - > What are most common types of crimes? 
  - > Which areas are prone to the different types of crimes to occur? 
  - > What is the pattern and likelihood of the crimes and frequency which changes over the day? Week? Year?
