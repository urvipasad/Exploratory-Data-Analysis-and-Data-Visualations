## EDA on Crime Rates in Boston City
Crime incident reports are provided by Boston Police Department (BPD) to document the initial details surrounding an incident to which BPD officers respond. This is a dataset containing records from the new crime incident report system, which includes a reduced set of fields focused on capturing the type of incident as well as when and where it occurred.
Records are from year  15th June 2015 to 13th October 2019.
